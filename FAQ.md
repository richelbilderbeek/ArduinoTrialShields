## How expensive is a Trial Shield?

About ten euros

## Can I make Trial Shields myself?

Yes, it is rather easy. All schematics and code are on this GitHub.

## Will you make a Trial Shield for me?

No. But I can give you two options:
 * I can help you build one
 * I can find people that like to build one
